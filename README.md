# BIOINFORMATICS HUB
The slack bioinformaticshub workspace is a platform specifically created to discuss bioinformatics among community of scientists and researchers in Nigeria.

To join the bioinformatics slack workspace, simply click on the [link](http://bioinformaticshub.slack.com)

## Our aims
_To facilitate sharing of bioinformatics knowledge among community of scientists in Nigeria_

## Content
The workspace contains a number of channels that can be used to do the following:-

1)	Share knowledge about basic bioinformatics, basic NGS, RNA-Seq, Chip-Seq and metagenomics data analyses.
2)	Discusses microarray, pathway and network analyses 
3)	Share and engage in discussion about drug design, molecular docking, functional and structural predictions etc.
4)	Share ideas on the basis of scientific programming using R, Python and Unix command line etc. 
5)	Discuss about statistical computing, data visualisation and explore genome browsers
6)	Share conferences and opportunities relevant to bioinformatics  
7)	Ask for help and help others in the hub
8)	Introduce yourself to the bioinformatics community in Nigeria. 


## How does it work?
Sign up at http://bioinformaticshub.slack.com or simply click [here](http://bioinformaticshub.slack.com). You need to have an institutional email account that is linked to one of the following domains name system (DNS): @basug.edu.ng, @abu.edu.ng, @buk.edu.ng, @gsu.edu.ng, @atbu.edu.ng, @udusok.edu.ng, @mautech.edu.ng, @aun.edu.ng, @adsu.edu.ng, @ysu.edu.ng, @ksu.edu.ng, @fud.edu.ng, @slu.edu.ng, @nwu.edu.ng, @umyu.edu.ng, @fudutsinma.edu.ng, @kustwudil.edu.ng, @unimaid.edu.ng, @naub.edu.ng, @nda.edu.ng, @alhikmah.edu.ng, @uniilorin.edu.ng, @nileuniversity.edu.ng, @uniabuja.edu.ng, @bazeuniversity.edu.ng, @tsuniversity.edu.ng, @kwasu.edu.ng, @fukashere.edu.ng, @fulafia.edu.ng, @unijos.edu.ng, @nsuk.edu.ng, @nabda.gov.ng, @tetfund.gov.ng, @nuc.edu.ng, @nvri.gov.ng, @nimr.gov.ng, @ncdc.gov.ng, @54gene.com, @uni.edu.ng, or @uniport.edu.ng. If you are a member of any Nigerian university or research institute interested in bioinformatics and your institutional domain is not listed above, [please kindly let us know](umarahmad1@icloud.com) and we will be happy to add your domain for you to Sign up.

[Slack](http://www.slack.com/) is an instant and popular workplace messaging platform that enhance project collaboration and is an amazing tool for bioinformatics communication [nature](http://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-use-slack-1.21228). You can install it on your desktop, your smartphone and even use it through an internet browser. 


## What’s next to do?
1)	Make use of this opportunity to share and exchange ideas with many others
2)	Appreciate Nigeria’s bioinformatics community
3)	Be polite and invite new people to join http://bioinformaticshub.slack.com/
4)	Within bioinformaticshub.slack.com, you can join any channels of your choice – be it first-steps, unix-bash, transcriptomics, workflow, single-cell, Python, metagenomics, galaxy, introductions, R, Perl, quality-control etc. 
5)	Add a picture and update your profile so that you will be recognised (optional). 

## Am I welcome?
You are welcome if you are interested in bioinformatics within Nigeria. You also don’t need to be a bioinformatician to join the workspace. We appreciate all areas of bioinformatics be it Next-generation sequencing (NGS), microarray, pathways and network, structural biology, scientific programming, system biology or computational genomics etc. We particularly welcome biologists, biomedical and medical scientists who are new to bioinformatics to join the workspace and share their ideas. 


## Who are we?
The bioinformatics slack workspace was created by Umar Ahmad sometimes in 2016 when he was pursuing his PhD at the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and the Malaysia Genome Institute (MGI). However, we are looking for volunteers to serve as administrators from Nigerian institutions. If you are interested, [please get in touch](umarahmad1@icloud.com).

**Umar Ahmad** is the founder and CEO of [BioSeq Consulting](https://bioseqc.com), a bioinformatics company that translates omics data into informative knowledge by providing quality high-throughput sequencing (NGS) data analysis. Umar's graduate training (PhD in cancer research) at [Genetics and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre](https://grmrc.org) of the Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) and the [Malaysia Genome Institute](https://mgi-nibm.my/v5/index.php) focused on developing targeted therapy for human bladder cancer with primary focus on cancer genomics and transcriptomics through bioinformatics analyses of NGS data such as transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. He is passionate about genetics and genomics, bioinformatics, computational biology and data science. Umar is voluntarily serving as the bioinformatics coordinator at [Science Communication Hub Nigeria](https://www.scicomnigeria.org), where he supports a team that provides mentorship, implement training and community building for the next generation of Nigerian scientists. He is currently the scholarly communication lead at [AfricArXiv](https://info.africarxiv.org)– The free preprint service for African scientists. He previously served as the Secretary to the Structure Organisation Committee (SOC) of the [Nigerian Bioinformatics and Genomics Network](http://www.nbgnetwork.org). He is a strong advocate for community building that support the data-intensive biomedical research community and underrepresented groups in STEM fields. Umar can be found on Twitter @[babasaraki1](https://twitter.com/babasaraki1).
